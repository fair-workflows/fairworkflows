# Ideas

## Entry in jupyter notebook cell
* Markup is generated in the cell corresponding to the RDF description of the manual step.
* A "results" input section of the cell allows user to input URI of expected/resultant data sets.
* Once output of manual task is specified, notebook may continue execution.

## CWL tool
* Optionally, command line prompt, or GUI prompt?
* Contact an expert? Several ways:
    * Contact a server, which processes the request and contacts the relevant expert, displaying the steps required, and giving them a graphical interface in which the desired results may be entered.
    * Emails the specified expert directly, with the instructions. Expert may reply to the email.


Test CWL manual tool with
```cwl-runner --preserve-entire-environment test_workflow.cwl --manual_mode commandline```

## Define manual step class in CWL spec?
* Include RDF description of manual steps
* Should be blocking? If the manual step depends on output of a previous step, then workflow needs to "wait" in some way until the manual task can be carried out.

## Higher level notebook
* Each cell in a notebook can trigger a CWL workflow, using the inputs/outputs specified in the notebook.
* Some cells are descriptions of manual tasks, followed by a prompt for the resulting data set that can be used as input to the next workflow.
